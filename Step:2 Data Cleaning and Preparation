**DATA COLLECTION**

I will be using Cyclistic’s historical trip data from January 2023 to December 2023 to analyze and identify trends. 
(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study,
the datasets are appropriate and will enable me to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license)
This is public data that I can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
But note that data-privacy issues prohibit me from using riders’ personally identifiable information.
This means that I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area 
or if they have purchased multiple single passes. The dataset can be found here.

The ride details with 13 variables is shown below:


**COMBINING ALL ROWS**


In order to clean and explore the data further, I had to choose SQL on google’s BigQuery platform.
The csv files were too large to be imported to Excel spreadsheet since they exceeded the capacity.
I downloaded the csv files from Jan till Dec 2023 (Note: Sep dataset was missing ) and imported them to SQL.
I then combined all the tables to Combined1_tripdata. Using the following query.
While uploading I was notified that local uploads are limited to only 100 mb. I had to use Google Cloud storage to import.
I created a bucket through Google Cloud storage to upload all the files to sql.
